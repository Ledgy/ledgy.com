### General

<Accordion>

<FAQ id="getting-started" question="How do I get started?">

Read our [Getting Started](/help/getting-started/) guide.

</FAQ>

<FAQ id="share-numbers" question="How can I enable share numbers?">

Go to your company’s *Settings* page and under your company details activate the *Share Numbers* toggle. Nice side-effect: This automatically adds consistent share numbers to your current transactions. It always takes the lowest available range of numbers for the next transaction.

</FAQ>

<FAQ id="convertible-loans" question="Where can I see my convertible loans?">

Go to the *Transactions* page and in the *Filter* field, type *Convertible loan*.

Or open the *Round Modeling* on the *Cap Table* page, click *Add* and *Outstanding Convertibles*. This also allows you to simulate the conversion of the loans (see [modelling section](https://ledgy.com/help/faq/#convert-convertibles-body)).

</FAQ>


<FAQ id="shareholder-groups" question="How can I create shareholder groups?">

Go to the *Stakeholders* page, click the three dots next to one, click *Edit* and type the group in the respective field. By default, the groups *Founders*, *Employees* and *Investors* already exist. To add a new group, simply start typing a name in the field and click on *Create new group*.

</FAQ>


<FAQ id="custom-vesting" question="How do I define a custom vesting?">

Let’s take an example: You have 80 options that vest over 48 months with 12 months cliff. After the first 12 months in which 20 options vest, each month 1 option vests for the remaining 36 months. A headache? Not with Ledgy. Choose custom vesting and define 3 periods:

1.  Percentage: 25, Duration: 12, Vest every: 12 months
2.  Percentage: 45, Duration: 36, Vest every: 1 month
3.  Percentage: 30, Duration: 0, Vest every: 0 month

</FAQ>

<FAQ id="browser" question="In which browser does the app work best?">

The app works best in Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. If you don’t use one of these browsers and notice a weird behavior, please let us know.

</FAQ>

<FAQ id="trusts" question="Can I manage pooled investments / trusts in my cap table? Can Ledgy differentiate between legal and economic owner?">

Yes, let’s say Bob and Alice hold shares through Bobs Trust Inc. Then you can show your cap table both in legal and economic terms. Here’s how to set it up:

1. Go on the *Stakeholder* page, add the Bob, Alice and Bobs Trust Inc. as new stakeholders, edit Bobs Trust Inc. and add Bob and Alice as its beneficiaries.
2. Go to the *Transactions* page, click *Add* and *Issue*. In the *To* field you can now select *Bob (via Bobs Trust Inc)* and *Alice (via Bobs Trust Inc).
3. Go to the *Cap Table* page, and you’ll see a new button *Legal* at the top left. Clicking it will switch to *Economic* view, showing Bob and Alice instead of Bobs Trust Inc. Notice the small *via Bobs Trust Inc* badge next to his shares.

You can also mix direct and indirect investments. For example Bobs Trust Inc. can hold some shares, as well as Bob through Bobs Trust Inc.

Bob will also see his indirect holdings in his Portfolio, with a *via Bobs Trust Inc* badge.

### Collaboration
<Accordion>

<FAQ id="invite-investor" question="How can I invite an investor to see my cap table?">

Go on the *Stakeholder* page, add you investor’s email address (at this point the shareholder does NOT receive any email). Then just click the invite button on the right-hand side. You can choose three access right levels.

1. **Personal** The investor will be able to see her stake in her [portfolio](/features/investors/).
2. **View-only** View everything, but not able to edit.
3. **Admin** Full access.

</FAQ>

<FAQ id="share-cap-table" question="How can I share my cap table?">

There are three ways:

1.  Grant view-only access to your shareholder (see above).
2.  Download the cap table as pdf on the *Cap Table* page and share it via email.
3.  On the *Documents* page you can upload your cap table export and activate link sharing. When you hover with your mouse on the link-sharing toggle, you will see the possibility of copying the link, which you can then share. At any time you can deactivate link sharing which will make the link invalid.

</FAQ>

<FAQ id="investor-login" question="Can investors also log in to see their stake?">

Every user on Ledgy has a portfolio where she can see her investments.

-   Find your portfolio: Click on your name (upper-right corner) then select portfolio.
-   See investments: The company you’ve invested in needs to add you as a shareholder with your email address and also needs to click on the *Commit* button on the *Transactions* page.

</FAQ>

<FAQ id="cap-table-changes" question="How can I see who made which changes to my cap table?">

Ledgy lets you work with multiple admins on the cap table. You can see a change history in the change log on the *Settings* page.

</FAQ>


<FAQ id="valuation" question="Why do my shareholder see no valuation in their portfolio?">

A _Valuation_ must be inserted and commited on the _Transactions_ page.

</FAQ>

</Accordion>


### Scenario Modeling
<Accordion>

<FAQ id="roi" question="How to see the return on investment (ROI) of a shareholder? Is it possible to model exit scenarios?">

Yes, the exit scenario modeling even takes liquidation preferences with a multiple, whether it’s participating with or without cap and interest into account.

On the *Cap Table* page, click on *Scenarios* at the top right and then on *Exit*. Enter an exit price at the top, then you will see your cap table with return and multiple for each stakeholder, by groups or by classes. It also helps you understand what happens with a breakpoint plot. Click on a different point on the plot, to see the exit scenario at that valuation.

</FAQ>

<FAQ id="stack-rounds" question="Can I stack several rounds on top of each other in the round modeling tool?">

Yes, that’s possible thanks to the Draft mode. Here’s how: Let’s say you would like to see how your cap table will look like after your upcoming series A and B.

1.  Go to the *Cap table* page, click on *Round modeling* at the upper-right corner and simulate your series A. Then click on apply. The new transactions will be created as a draft. You can have a look at them on the *Transactions* page.
2.  Now your cap table status is post series A. Repeat the process above for your series B in the *Round modeling*.

That’s it! To remove these series A and B transactions from your draft, go to the *Transactions* page and click on the *Reset* button. But make sure there were no other remaining changes to your transactions before resetting.

</FAQ>

<FAQ id="convert-convertibles" question="How do I convert my convertible loans?">

There are two ways of converting convertible loans:

1.  Through the round modeling tool, which also [calculates for you](https://blog.ledgy.com/convertible-loans-7948385a5d66) how many shares should be issued for the convertible, taking the cap, discount and interest into account. Go to the *Cap Table* page and click on *Round Modeling*. Existing convertibles should already be displayed. If not, add them by clicking on *Add* and then *Remaining Convertibles.*
2.  Find your convertible loan on the *Transactions* page. Then click on the menu (dots) in the transaction itself and select *Convert*. You need to calculate the number of shares yourself.

</FAQ>

<FAQ id="SAFE-convertibles" question="Do you also support SAFE convertibles?">

Yes. The conversion can be a bit tricky, because if an employee pool is created during the round, it is taken into account for the conversion of the SAFE. Ledgy does the math for you, so you're on the safe side ;-)

1. Add your SAFE as a convertible loan on the *Transactions* page.
2. Add it to the [round modeling](https://ledgy.com/help/faq/#convert-convertibles-body).
3. Click on *Actions* on the top right and then on *Settings*. Make sure *Include convertibles in share price* and *Include pools in share price* are activated.

### Documents and Reports

<Accordion>

<FAQ id="cap-table-csv" question="How do I best open my cap table in CSV format?">

Read our [quick guide](https://blog.ledgy.com/csv-export-96215c180194) to smoothly import CSV in Excel or Google sheets with special characters and separation formatting.

</FAQ>


<FAQ id="blockchain-notary" question="What is the blue badge next to the documents? What is the blockchain notary?">

The blockchain notary takes any document on Ledgy and registers a certificate on the Bitcoin blockchain. Thus, during due diligence, it is possible to take any document and check on Ledgy if and when it was uploaded on Ledgy, by whom, and that it hasn’t been changed since then.

Only a certificate (the hash in more technical terms) is stored on the blockchain, not the document itself. So there’s no privacy risk at all.

When committing new changes to your cap table, a pdf report is automatically generated and saved to your documents. This creates a bullet-proof due diligence chain which you can later use to impress potential investors or buyers.

<FAQ id="beneficiary" question="Why do I need to specify a beneficiary for institutional investors who hold more than 25% of the company in Switzerland (Meldepflicht)?">
