    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Size of the pool</td>
      <td>
        Number of options reserved for employees, with one option equal to one common share of the company.<br /><br />
        It is often also expressed in percent of the total shares.
      </td>
      <td>
        Discuss with your board, they have to approve the plan.<br /><br />
        Common practice at the seed stage is 5 - 10% of the company’s share capital on a fully diluted basis. This typically goes up to 20% during the company lifetime.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Vesting</td>
      <td>
        <ol>
          <li>Number of years</li>
          <li>Cliff or not</li>
          <li>Interval of allocation</li>
        </ol>
      </td>
      <td>
        Discuss with your board. Common practice is 3 - 4 years duration, monthly allocation, 1 year cliff.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Accelerated vesting at exit, change of control or IPO</td>
      <td>
        Choose among 3 possibilities:
        <ol>
          <li>Single trigger: Automatic full vesting</li>
          <li>
            Double trigger: Automatic full vesting only if<br />
            (i) transaction (exit, change of control, IPO) occurred and <br />
            (ii) a certain number of months pass after the transaction (e.g. 12) or termination of employment
          </li>
          <li>Accelerated vesting only as determined by board of directors</li>
        </ol>
      </td>
      <td>
        Also this you should discuss with your investors. The common practice is 1 but 2 is also often seen, especially in the US.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Exercise Price of Option (strike price)</td>
      <td>
        Choose between
        <ol>
          <li>Corresponding to nominal value of common share</li>
          <li>Fair market value (or formula value) of one common registered share at time of grant (to be confirmed from tax law point of view)</li>
        </ol>
        If you want to implement a tax-ruling to agree with the tax authority on a formula value of the common registered shares upon exercise of the options.
      </td>
      <td>
        The common practice in seed stage companies is 1. It is also the most employee friendly.<br /><br />
        Tax ruling: In order to maximally take advantage of the tax optimization, a tax ruling is recommended. However it can also be done at a later time point (but before the first exercises).
      </td>

    <tr>
      <td>Funding</td>
      <td>
        Choose between
        <ol>
          <li>Conditional share capital</li>
          <li>Authorized share capital</li>
          <li>Treasury shares (and if the shares come from specific shareholders such as founders)</li>
        </ol>
      </td>
      <td>The common practice is a conditional share capital.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Termination <strong>during</strong> Vesting Period</td>
      <td>
        If the company should have a repurchase right on vested options in case the employee’s employment is terminated (in good terms).
      </td>
      <td>
        The common practice is to have a repurchase right even though it is rarely exercised.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Termination <strong>after</strong> Vesting Period</td>
      <td>
        If the company should have a repurchase right on vested options if the employee’s employment is terminated (in good terms).
