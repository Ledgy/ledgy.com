#### The parameters you need to decide

      <th>Parameter</th>
      <th>What to decide</th>
      <th>How to decide</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Size of the pool</td>
      <td>
        Number of virtual shares reserved for employees, with one virtual share equal to one common share of the company.<br /><br />
        It is often also expressed in percent of the total shares.
      </td>
      <td>
        Discuss with your board, they have to approve the plan.<br /><br />
        Common practice at the seed stage is 5 - 10% of the company’s share capital on a fully diluted basis. This typically goes up to 20% during the company lifetime.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Vesting</td>
      <td>
        <ol>
          <li>Number of years</li>
          <li>Cliff or not</li>
          <li>Interval of allocation</li>
        </ol>
      </td>
      <td>
        Discuss with your board. Common practice is 3 - 4 years duration, monthly allocation, 1 year cliff.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Accelerated vesting at exit, change of control or IPO</td>
      <td>
        Choose among 3 possibilities:
        <ol>
          <li>Single trigger: Automatic full vesting</li>
          <li>
            Double trigger: Automatic full vesting only if<br />
            (i) transaction (exit, change of control, IPO) occurred and <br />
            (ii) a certain number of months pass after the transaction (e.g. 12) or termination of employment
          </li>
          <li>Accelerated vesting only as determined by board of directors</li>
        </ol>
      </td>
      <td>
        Also this you should discuss with your investors. The common practice is 1 but 2 is also often seen, especially in the US.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Triggering Cash-Events</td>
      <td>
        Several types of events can trigger a payment to phantom holders: the payment of dividends, a voluntary liquidation, a change of control / exit (transfer of >50% of voting rights or sale of its assets) or IPO.<br /><br />
        Most are standard, but you should decide whether you want dividend payments to be a triggering event.
      </td>
      <td>
        Think about whether your startup could someday give out dividends or if will aim for an exit before.<br /><br />
        Common practice: Usually dividends are no triggering event, as it adds another layer of complexity.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Termination <strong>during</strong> Vesting Period</td>
      <td>
        If the company should have a repurchase right on vested options in case the employee’s employment is terminated (in good terms).
      </td>
      <td>
        The common practice is to have a repurchase right even though it is rarely exercised.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Termination <strong>after</strong> Vesting Period</td>
      <td>
        If the company should have a repurchase right on vested awards in case the employee is terminated (in good terms).
      </td>
      <td>
        The common practice is to have a repurchase right even though it is rarely exercised.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Virtual options or shares</td>
      <td>A phantom plan can mirror options with a strike price.</td>
      <td>Mostly only virtual share plans are used.</td>
