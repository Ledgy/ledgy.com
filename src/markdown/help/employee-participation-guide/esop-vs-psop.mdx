The following guide will help you decide whether to choose phantom or option plan.

### ESOP

##### Pro
* A standard that is more accepted in other countries.
* Employees who exercise options become real shareholders, putting them on the same level as the founders and investors. This makes them feel more strongly connected to the company and motivates them to stick with it longer.

##### Contra
* Exercising process adds a complexity layer
  * Harder to understand for employees who are not experienced in this field. For example they have to decide if and when they want to exercise.
  * The company needs to go to the notary once a year if options are exercised
  * Employees have to pay income and social taxes when exercising. This usually requires a tax ruling to reduce the tax burden, which costs once to set up.
  * Employee who exercise have voting rights in the general assembly and therefore also certain right to information. Some companies don’t feel comfortable with this.

### PSOP

##### Pro
* Only contractual agreement, no real share issuances/transfers involved, which makes it easier to administer (e.g. no need to go to the notary)
* Easier to understand for employees who don’t have experience with options and the process of exercising them (just get a share of the exit sum, that’s it)
* Employees only pay taxes when money is flowing, which makes it easier to bear

##### Contra
* No tax optimization: Payment of more taxes overall compared to ESOP plan.
* Employees don’t become real shareholders, putting them on a second layer compared to the founders and investors. This gives them less security that their rights are protected and makes them feel less connected to the company, reducing their long-term commitment.
