We are Ledgy, a SaaS startup from Zurich, looking for a Web Developer to grow our team.

Ledgy is a SaaS tool to manage the equity of private companies. It helps to democratize ownership in startups by assisting founders to grant equity to their employees. We’ve also developed a first concept to bring shares of startups on the Ethereum blockchain.

Our [customers](/) are successful companies from Switzerland and other European countries, like VIU, Farmy, or the Crypto Finance AG.

As a full-stack Web Developer at Ledgy, you can
* Crunch financial data in isomorphic JavaScript (browser & Node.js)
* Become a master of functional programming
* Build a modern API on GraphQL
* Learn to type a large project in TypeScript
* Be the first to use React Hooks in a production app
* Push the limits of a full-stack Node.js web framework (Meteor)
* Design a scalable & secure software architecture that handles confidential data of thousands of companies
* Give talks on international conferences about any of the above topics

We are a young team that graduated from ETH Zurich in 2017. All of our product is developed in-house, by us. We are inspired by the startup scene and hacker spirit in Silicon Valley and want to bring this vibe to Switzerland. (We have once been [invited](https://blog.ledgy.com/our-interview-at-y-combinator-e1131fd89ecc) to Y Combinator for an interview.) Our advisors have founded Doodle, Wuala and other successful companies and our investors are selected as the digital shapers of Switzerland by the Bilanz magazine.
