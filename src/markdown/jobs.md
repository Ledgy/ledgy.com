We are Ledgy, a SaaS startup from Zurich, looking for a Full-Stack Web Developer to grow our team.

Ledgy is a SaaS tool to manage the equity of private companies. It helps to democratize ownership in startups by assisting founders to grant equity to their employees. We’ve also developed a first concept to bring shares of startups on the Ethereum blockchain.

Our [customers](/) are successful companies from Switzerland and other European countries, like VIU, Farmy, or the Crypto Finance AG.

We are a young team that graduated from ETH Zurich in 2017. All of our product is developed in-house, by us. We are inspired by the startup scene and hacker spirit in Silicon Valley and want to bring this vibe to Switzerland. (We have once been [invited](https://blog.ledgy.com/our-interview-at-y-combinator-e1131fd89ecc) to Y Combinator for an interview.) Our advisors have founded Doodle, Wuala and other successful companies and our investors are selected as the digital shapers of Switzerland by the Bilanz magazine.

We have developed an open source [​two-factor authentication​](https://blog.meteor.com/tutorial-two-factor-authentication-with-meteor-and-totp-21d4a2f9ee51), a modern [​landing page with GatsbyJS​](https://github.com/morloy/ledgy.com), a [​blockchain notary​](https://blog.ledgy.com/the-ledgy-blockchain-notary-3fb3dc423aae), and have a cool [​demo​](https://demo.ledgy.com/).

###### As a full-stack web developer at Ledgy, you can
* Crunch financial data in isomorphic JavaScript (browser & Node.js)
* Become a master of functional programming
* Build a modern API on GraphQL
* Learn to type a large project in TypeScript
* Be the first to use React Hooks in a production app
* Push the limits of a full-stack Node.js web framework (Meteor)
* Design a scalable & secure software architecture that handles confidential data of thousands of companies
* Give talks on international conferences about any of the above topics

###### We don’t require any formal skill, but
* You should be able to give a meaningful solution to our [​Coding Challenge​](https://gist.github.com/morloy/40bc8469cef175c7607a437ac37d4110)
* It’s great if you have some experience with web development
* It’s really cool if you have previously worked with any of the technologies mentioned above
* We’d absolutely love to meet you if you’ve made major contributions to an open source project

###### At Ledgy, you will
* Be part of a company that scales from Switzerland to being the major player in whole Europe
* Generous stock options (that will, of course, grow by 1000×)
* Work with passionate team of outdoor, meditation, and space enthusiasts
