EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an important step to strengthen data privacy rights to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe. The regulation was approved by the EU Parliament in April 2016 and came into effect on May 25, 2018. GDPR affects companies processing or controlling personal data of data subjects located in the EU.

### What is personal data?

Personal data consists of any information that allows identifying a person directly or indirectly. This could be such things as a name, an email address, bank details, an IP address or a social media post.
* Art. 4 GDPR: ‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
