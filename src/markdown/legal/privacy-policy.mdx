### 4 Personal data security

A list of measures can be found on our [Security](/security/) page.

While we endeavor to always protect our systems, sites, operations, and information against unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle and other risk factors, we cannot guarantee that any information, during transfer or storage, will be absolutely safe from interception.

**Disclosure to third parties**<br />
We do not share Cap Table Data with anyone except as explicitly instructed by the company.

**Cross-border transfers**<br />

**Cross-border transfers**<br />
General Personal Data may be transferred to the countries where our Recipients are located.
If we transfer data to a country without adequate legal data protection, we take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that such transfer and storage is in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the applicable data protection legislation.


We may be legally required to disclose Personal Data to courts, arbitral tribunals or other authorities for the purposes of a legal or administrative proceeding. Where reasonably possible, we will inform you about such disclosure.

You may request a copy of your Cap Table Data at any time, even in the event of bankruptcy of Ledgy. Please note that this right may not be guaranteed in the event of bankruptcy due to legal uncertainty and that a fee may be charged.

##### Right to object to processing
Where the Legal Ground for our processing of your Personal Data is our legitimate interest, you have the right to object to such processing on grounds relating to your particular situation.
