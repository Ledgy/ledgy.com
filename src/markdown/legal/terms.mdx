Your privacy is important to us. Ledgy, therefore, implements [strict security measures](/security/), including encryption during transmissions of Data and regular backups, to secure your Data against accidental loss, theft, or unauthorized access or disclosure. The following document is, by reference, part of this Agreement:

Our [Privacy Policy](/privacy/) which describes the types of Data we collect from you, how we use it, the legal basis for processing, and your rights.

Our [Data Processing Addendum](/legal/dpa/) if you qualify as the data controller. The Data Processing Addendum states the terms under which we process your Data on behalf of the data controller (typically the company whose equity we manage). In case we process your Data on behalf of a data controller, please directly contact the data controller for further information and requests relating to the processing of your Data.

This responsibility applies regardless of whether the Account Activity is authorized by you or undertaken by you, an external user, your employees, employees of the Customer you represent, or a third party (including your contractors and agents) and applies also to unauthorized access to the extent caused by your gross negligence. Ledgy is never responsible for unauthorized access to your account, although special conditions apply in case of a security breach (cf. our Data Processing Addendum).
3. You are responsible for protecting and securing your user name and password from unauthorized use and disclosure. If you become aware of or believe there has been, any breach of security for any of your information stored on our websites, such as the theft or unauthorized use of your user name, password, or any other information, you will notify Ledgy immediately.
4. You consent that the Website, as a part of delivering the Services to you, may send emails to third parties on your behalf, as triggered by your account activity.
5. You will ensure that any Data you register, upload or share via the Services and your usage of the Services will not violate any of the agreements you have entered into with Ledgy or any applicable law.

7. The Services are intended for informational purposes only without regard to any particular entity’s investment objectives, financial situation, or means, and Ledgy is not soliciting any action based upon it.

This Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and will remain in effect until terminated pursuant to the clauses in this Section. The Order Confirmation will indicate the Effective Date as well as the duration.

Either Party can cancel the subscribed services by giving 30 days prior notice towards the end of a term.

#### 7.2 Termination

In addition to the above right to termination, you may terminate your Agreement with immediate effect in case the reason for the termination is your express disagreement to our material alteration of these Terms or the Services and termination notice is within the change assessment period defined in Section 8.

Ledgy may also, at its sole discretion and at any time, suspend or discontinue your use of the Services without prior notice, and without any liabilities of any kind, in case Ledgy reasonably suspects or determines that your use of the Services in any way that materially violates this Agreement, is fraudulent, or if needed to comply with the law or requests from public authorities. Ledgy may, at its sole discretion and at any time, and without any liabilities of any kind, suspend or discontinue your use of the Services with 10 days’ prior notice, in case Ledgy suspects or determines that your use of the Services poses a security risk, could impact the operations of our systems or delivery of the Services, could subject Ledgy or a third party to a substantial liability, or if you become the subject of bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation, or similar; in such cases, Ledgy shall provide a reasonably detailed motivation for the suspension or discontinuation. In case of suspension, you remain liable for all fees and charges incurred during the suspension period.

#### 7.3 After Termination

Upon the termination, you remain responsible for all fees and charges you have incurred until the termination date. We will not take action to remove, block, anonymize, reduce the availability of, or in any way alter any of your Data until 90 days after the termination date and you may request to export your Data. Thereafter, we may delete your Data. If you use the Services after the termination date, the terms of this Agreement will still apply in that period, and you will pay the applicable fees and charges for the usage of the Services in this period.
