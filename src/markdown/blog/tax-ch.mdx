A startup's equity has a certain value and thus needs to be declared to the tax office yearly. Here's a mini guide of how to communicate the equity's value to your startup's investors and employees.

#### Stock


#### Stock options
What you should communicate: Number of options granted to the person with value: 0. Declare it alongside of the salary statement for employees and send a Holding confirmation (a fancy word for a sheet on which is writte how many shares or stock options the investor holds) to your investors. For exercised options: see *Stock* section.

#### Phantom stock options
Similarly to stock options: Number of phantom stock options granted with value:0. Declare it alongside of the salary statement for employees and send a Holding confirmation to your investors.

#### A concrete example with VIU Eyeware using Ledgy
Viu has stock and phantom stock options for employees.
