A startup's equity has a certain value and thus needs to be declared to the tax office yearly. Here's a mini guide of how to communicate the equity's value to your startup's investors and employees.

#### Stock
In short, you need to communicate the number of shares your investor or employee holds, together with the corresponding tax value.<br/>
How to calculate this tax value? In the case of startups it is calculated according to a guideline grouping several recognized methods by the [swiss tax authorities](http://www.steuerkonferenz.ch/downloads/kreisschreiben/KS_28_Final_D_20180326.pdf) (future updates to this guideline can be found [here](http://www.steuerkonferenz.ch/?Dokumente:Kreisschreiben)). The startup's board has to officially decide which
calculation method among the recognized ones will be taken. To be a 100% sure that the chosen formula will also be accepted by the tax office, the startup can also send the chosen calculation to the tax office for an official approval, called ***Steuerruling***. <br/>
The above guideline is valid in every canton in Switzerland. If you are based in Zurich, there is even a [special rule for startups](https://www.steueramt.zh.ch/internet/finanzdirektion/ksta/de/steuerbuch/zuercher-steuerbuch-definition/zstb-39-1.html), that allows you to declare your equity's value at a very low price.
This has been established to encourage startups in the canton of Zurich.

#### Stock options
What you should communicate: Number of options granted to the person with value: 0. Declare it alongside of the salary statement for employees and send a holding confirmation to your investors. For exercised options: see *Stock* section.

#### Phantom stock options
Similarly to stock options: Number of phantom stock options granted with value: 0. Declare it alongside of the salary statement for employees and send a holding confirmation to your investors.

#### A concrete example with VIU Eyeware using Ledgy
VIU has stock and phantom stock options for employees. We're proud that Ledgy helps making VIU's process of sending holding confirmations easier.
Indeed, instead of the cumbersome process of copy-pasting values from an excel sheet into individual emails, Ledgy provides a ready-to-be-downloaded holding confirmation for all stakeholders.
